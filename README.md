# Happiness Prediction Model

This project is an AI model designed to predict happiness levels based on a set of input parameters. The model was developed and trained on Google Colab, leveraging various machine learning techniques to analyze the relationship between input features and happiness scores. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and how to use the model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to predict a "Happiness Index" for individuals based on several key parameters such as economic status, social support, health, freedom, and more. Using data-driven insights, this model aims to contribute to research and tools that help understand factors influencing happiness at individual and societal levels.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Framework**: This model was built using popular ML libraries available in Python, including Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow.
- **Google Colab**: All the model training and initial testing were conducted on Google Colab, which provides a flexible and powerful environment for building and training ML models.
- **Customizable Parameters**: The model can be tailored to predict happiness based on specific features selected by the user, making it adaptable for different datasets and research needs.
  
## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **Google Colab**: For training and running the model.
- **Scikit-Learn**: For data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building deep learning models if required.

## Dataset

The model was trained on a dataset containing various happiness indicators. You can replace this with any dataset that contains the relevant features for happiness prediction.

### Sample Parameters
- **Income Level**: Economic status of the individual.
- **Health Index**: General health score.
- **Social Support**: Level of social support received.
- **Freedom to Make Life Choices**: How free individuals feel in making life decisions.
- **Generosity**: Measure of social trust and charitable giving.

## Model Training and Testing

The model was trained and validated on Google Colab. Below is a brief outline of the steps taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Feature Selection**: Selected the most relevant features to improve the model's accuracy.
3. **Model Training**: Implemented a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Network) for predicting happiness.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account
- Required libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `tensorflow` (if using deep learning)

### Installation

If you wish to run this model locally instead of on Google Colab:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/happiness-prediction
   cd happiness-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Data Upload**: Load your dataset into Google Colab or your local environment.
2. **Model Training**: Follow the `notebook.ipynb` provided in the repo to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
3. **Predictions**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict happiness scores by providing new data.

## Deployment

To deploy this model, you may export it and integrate it with a web application. Consider using **Flask** for creating an API endpoint that can serve the model predictions in a production environment, or deploy it directly on your website if using frameworks like React with Tailwind and NextUI.

## Results and Insights

The model shows promising results in predicting happiness scores, with an accuracy that varies based on the dataset used and parameters selected. Further tuning and larger datasets could potentially improve its predictive power.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model's parameters for better accuracy.
- **Expand Features**: Add more relevant features to improve prediction reliability.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploy on a website or mobile app to allow real-time happiness score predictions.
